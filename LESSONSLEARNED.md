# LESSONSLEARNED.md

Tracked durable lessons for `clockwork`.
Unlike `CHATHISTORY.md`, this file should keep only reusable lessons that
should change how future sessions work in this repo.

## How To Use

- Read this file after `AGENTS.md` and before `CHATHISTORY.md` when resuming
  work.
- Add lessons that generalize beyond a single session.
- Keep entries concise and action-oriented.
- Do not use this file for transient status updates or full session logs.

## Lessons

- Keep tracked example manifests generic: use placeholder paths, usernames, and
  local config locations instead of publishing a real host's filesystem layout
  or service-account names.
- Document the repository around its real execution, curation, or integration
  flow instead of only the top-level folder list.
- Keep local-only, private, reference-only, or generated boundaries explicit so
  published or runtime behavior is not confused with offline material or
  non-committable inputs.
- Re-run repo-appropriate validation after changing generated artifacts,
  diagrams, workflows, or other CI-facing files so formatting and compatibility
  issues are caught before push.
